In Priority (Move things around as necessary):
- [ ] Compatible on both OSes (keep checking regularly if possible)
- [ ] Bug test!!!
  - Shapes and different drawing modes don't work. If you click it just draws a line randomly and then its the normal brush
  - Possibly from moving to processing
- [ ] Change brush color
- [ ] Draw on/import a prexisting image not just canvas files
- [ ] Add a side toolbar along with the menu one
- [ ] Different brushes and brush sizes (e.g. pencil, normal brush, changing opacity and hardness of brush)
- [ ] Bug test!!!
  - Make sure all tools work as intended
- [ ] Fix canvas size changing when resizing the window (it should make the window bigger but you can only draw on a designated area)
- [ ] Option for resizing the canvas
- [ ] Undo and Redo functions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for everything (e.g. CMD/CTRL+S is save)
- [ ] Drawing layers
- [ ] Blend modes
- [ ] Masking (Look it up)
- [ ] Selection tools to select specific parts of the drawing
- [ ] Bug test!!!
  - Make sure all drawing things work as planned
- [ ] Cleaner UI with nice graphics and loading screen (JButtons are really useful for popups instead of your current confirm button and JButtons also look more uniform with other apps)
- [ ] Bug test!!!
  - Look for small things like mispelling things
- [ ] Logo
- [ ] Instructions/Help
- [ ] Tutorials
- [ ] Filters and weird things like 3D that aren't really that important but nice

On the side:
- [ ] Try out other forms of input like with keyboard or a constant drawing mode along with selection mode
