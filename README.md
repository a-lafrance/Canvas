# Canvas

Canvas is (was) my final project for Homestead's Intro to Java class as a sophomore in high school. As far as I can remember, I had a good time writing it and 
I learned a lot in doing so. Credit to Mr. Shelby for allowing us to pick our own final project ideas, and for teaching me the Java I needed to make the project happen.

Note that, seeing as it's been about 5 years since I've touched this code, I'm officially "deprecating" it (despite the fact that it wasn't ever really well-written enough for real-world use anyway). 
As should be obvious by now, I'll no longer be touching this code, and I'll adjust the repository settings to reflect this. (Note also that I'm pretty sure the 
code is out of date and may not even work anymore, but again it's been a long time since I've touched this code so I can't definitively say one way or another).

If, for some reason, you'd like to use this code, feel free to fork the repo and use/extend it however you like. Even though I won't be interacting with the code anymore 
I won't stop you from doing so if you'd like.

It was fun creating "bootleg MS Paint", but sadly that journey has (long since) come to an end.
